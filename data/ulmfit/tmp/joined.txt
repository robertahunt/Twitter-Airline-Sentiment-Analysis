 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue i spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they ca n't help . need help with family pooling asap .

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways us 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into gatwick , not heathrow . moments of concern for all aboard .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair and it 's not a inconvenience it is a disaster . it 's a $ 500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
 xbos xfld 1 @virginamerica you should still develop an app - then you will be my favorite airline .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair yep , they moved me to t_up 16a as they showed me flying " standby "

 xbos xfld 1 @united the engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat t_up 27a should be forced to always sit here
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair i 'm in line at the airport right now . will you cover hotel fair or am i to sleep in the airport ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united i think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3 pm flight to fill the other one then cancelled flightled mine

 xbos xfld 1 @americanair already spoke to that line , unwilling to help - really poor support # hitawall
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair guys 5350 in dfw stuck at the gate for half an hour . do we pull the slide or what ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united no . the entire problem here is that i was never sent anything via email and only given a flight booking problems number over the phone .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways already tried . how about conf # via dm
 xbos xfld 1 @united can you dm me ? been on hold with customer service very long time ( 53 min + ) and getting the run - around . thanks .
 xbos xfld 1 keep waiting , time does not cost anything for @jetblue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http : / / t.co / ji2pg4gom9
 xbos xfld 1 @virginamerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via t_up your confirmation email . when i inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks !
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue but the 4 hour policy- when i called and they said i did n't report it soon enough . what would have changed if i had noticed sooner ?
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue thank you for the service credit . and to @pamgrout for positive thoughts .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair i use to # t_up luv swa but after an hour and counting on hold , for a flight they cancelled flighted on me ? # noluv
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair you completely let me down tonight . your gate agents ' ambivalence is just too much . how sad for you ( & & me . )
 xbos xfld 1 @united yes . on a nonstop to memphis tomorrow morning . with the snow coming in i got my fingers crossed it will go .
 xbos xfld 1 @united @unitedappeals @gg8929 what kind of hypocrisy is that ? only cancelled flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage # united
 xbos xfld 1 @united keep the flights cheap and early / on time and you are good . flew @americanair and cancelled flightled my flight 4 times last month . united >
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half . they did n't even let us off .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair great flight ! and great view ! http : / / t.co / aufm4xdaj2
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair @usairways " ma'am if you have a complaint you should visit our customer service desk " { sees line ~45 people deep }
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue my wife was with our dog . they would n't even let her out off the plane . my daughter was at newburgh lives close by . so wrong
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair yes - with extra $ 77 . i wonder what are you going yo loose , if there is room .
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue when will the system be up and running ?
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls . is there a 24hrs cancelled flightlation policy ? booked yesterday need to cancelled flight
 xbos xfld 1 @united truly the t_up worst day of flying i have ever experienced ...

 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue remember - i 'm very doubtful and not very hopeful :(
 xbos xfld 1 @united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue i 'm getting info from the website , but needing to check it and the alerts would be much more beneficial .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways yes , there is horrible snow . but seriously , can you not hire more people to answer the phones ? competitor have call back numbers .
 xbos xfld 1 @united looks like they came through . thanks again for the help .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair big thanks to your team . family emerg , same day ticket , experience was excellent . 1st time flying with y all , not my last !
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue a voucher .. i ca n't believe i took this risk . not only was the plane terribly filthy and i had 15 screaming babies in my face ..
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways i 've been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt . i know you guys are busy but i think it 's time to higher more staff !
 xbos xfld 1 @united do you have plans for an ipad app ? the iphone app is great , but on the ipad you have to flip the ipad . is there a beta ? tks .
 xbos xfld 1 @united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again . it 's t_up still in newark . please help or let me know next steps ! !
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair you cxl both my flights to / from t_up dfw to t_up cll w / o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation ? t_up wth ?
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue terrible landing on 915

 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair at fort launder dale and the gate agent ca n't switch flights to an earlier flight but we can on our phone ... ridiculous

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways cancelled flightled our original flight to aruba . now on the way home we were told we do n't have seats . never flying @usairways again
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair the issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so late flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways this is the worst flying experience of my life . flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from phl . 5 + hrs late flightr guess where i am ?

 xbos xfld 1 @americanair if it i have not rebooked did n't get notified that it was cancelled flightled
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair i guess it is more bs airportcardio given you can not have an on time flight
 xbos xfld 1 @united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $ 200 . loyal flier for 10 years - time for change .
 xbos xfld 1 @united i will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane does n't arrive until 6:07

 xbos xfld 1 @americanair makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all . they keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways if my flight is going to be cancelled flightled every week i might as well be in business class .

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways not going as planned is an understatement . my flight was just changed t_up again . if it were n't for a family emergency , i 'd cancelled flight .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair got it , so it 's just paying extra not to sit in the way back . awesome . never again .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways your whole handling of this was a joke.boston logan had one little old lady , t_up one handling all the customers http : / / t.co / dh2rfuijyp
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair also the problem is not calling us at all . other airlines send an automatic call and email , and they rebook as a courtesy .
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue i did get the email . thought i was n't supposed to reply to those üòÇ
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways the call hung up on me ..
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair i ca n't keep dialing you guys all day . can i get into the callback queue ?

 xbos xfld 1 @americanair thanks for forcing me to check -in my carry - on luggage . that is exactly why i spent extra money on " travel size " toiletries
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair yes . however , the seats they assign us that day are never together . i just want to sit with my husband ! why is that impossible ?
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair i 've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now . thanks for cancelled flighting my flight and not notifying me .
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue and the 20min line i stood in to drop my bag off ?
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways you mean 10:30pm . i 'd be in vegas by now if i 'd been allowed on my original flight .
 xbos xfld 1 @united thanks for letting me sleep at t_up dia to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible . wait , no , fuck you . # unitedairlinessucks
 xbos xfld 1 @united thanks . that means i have 30 minutes to make my international connection to t_up hkg
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane , there are are newborns on board

 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue when i arrived at the airport , i was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert .

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways interesting you forward compliments but never complaints ! world 's worst airline # goingforgreatnessfail
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair while i 'm aggravated - should n't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped ?
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways @americanair thank you for a couple of easy , hassle free flights today , professional and friendly staff made everything easy !
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair you need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair finally !
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair t_up sfo . natt ( the agent who helped me ) really did an awesome job .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways i made a reservation online but i did n't receive any confirmation email . my bank said the transaction went through . can u help ?

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways we might need a plane to get somewhere but just remember that you are n't the only choice # makeovertime # customerserviceplease
 xbos xfld 1 @united current hold time t_up after speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long & & why not make this option available online ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united : no friendly skies from you today . 5hr+ weather delay in t_up sfo followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane . # nofun
 xbos xfld 1 @united jt the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue if there is a " processing error " the why do you send out full flight tickets and confirmations ? # flysouthwest
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways that 's ok , just know that i 'll most likely never book with you again
 xbos xfld 1 @united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair was n't offered a flight out of t_up phl until t_up tuesday so had to ask to be booked to houston instead of austin .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair is there anyway to pay more to get priority boarding a 1 - 15 ?
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue charleston - from your app guys as of a few minutes ago ! ! ! http : / / t.co / seulpvfn95
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue it is absurd that i have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is late flight . you do nt have others ?
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair that 's unacceptable . they should allow me to wait on hold , or take my number and call me themselves .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways i expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight ...
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue tickets were confirmed and sent out . find out today that they cancelled flightled our tickets months ago and never sent an email # jetblue
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair yeah , 7 am flight tomorrow , going to add 60 - 90 min extra because of the roads / snow
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue i m just saying change can be amazing , like miami . üòâ
 xbos xfld 1 @united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
 xbos xfld 1 @united could you update me on the suitcase please ? the online and phone tracking told me nothing . i was told i 'd have it back yesterday !
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 t_up mia- t_up cur . how can i see if they made it onto the flight ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united wind chill in ithica -17 degrees , and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t - shirt . i 'll burn it for warmth . # united
 xbos xfld 1 @united do you mean " fortunately " ? i do n't want my flight to be affected ! üòâ
 xbos xfld 1 @united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour . not given any info .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways u guys suck
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue can you ask t_up slc checkin / bag drop if they found a dark blue / blackish fit bit flex ? would 've lost it there around 445pm mt
 xbos xfld 1 @united why do you bother surveying me !
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair i 'm teaching new # travelers how to research , # budget & & # save for a trip today ! http : / / t.co / qll48r57ep
 xbos xfld 1 @united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how i feel about your overpriced sub par airline

 xbos xfld 1 @united also checked email you have on file for me and it is correct
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair i have n't been rebooked . i called and left my number for a callback but have n't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow . :(

 xbos xfld 1 @united you make it hard to fly with you . delayed over an hour and now the plane is turning around & & heading back to the gate . # connection ?
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue of my tray table is broken what do i do ?
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways your software is broken . " call customer support " is not the fix . like i said earlier , yell at your developers .
 xbos xfld 1 @united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair i will say that your customer service has consistently been the very best ! ! !
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair ca n't fly in precipitation and @delta has planes that do n't work after 5 . 3rd airline had better be a charm tomorrow .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair @united and a complete lack of faith in your companies . it 's really a shame that you think telling me " it 's been a challenging "
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in dc thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways when your routing system goes down which grounds all your long haul flights you should think about a # failover plan
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways what is policy on changing flight to different dates once your flight has been delayed ?
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways so you do n't have a pilot now for # clt ‚úà # ord for at least another hour . why on earth would you board the plane ? makes no sense !
 xbos xfld 1 @united i do not see where it talks about military baggage fees . can you please guide me . thanks

 xbos xfld 1 @united do you also want the naming rights to my first child so i can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression ?
 xbos xfld 1 @virginamerica it 's really aggressive to blast obnoxious " entertainment " in your guests ' faces & & they have little recourse

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways $ 75 for that uncertainty ? i know u run an account ; u do n't create policy . but it 's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways no we have n't because we 've been in the same line at the service desk for an 1hr and 1 / 2 now in the same spot .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways it was n't weather this morning . t_up awe1701 diverted back to t_up bos due to mechanical issues . so far lost one of 3 days :(
 xbos xfld 1 @united i 've been doing this for 15 years and i 've never had this many issues with any other airline .

 xbos xfld 1 @united so many delays today ... what 's up with that ? hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon . # united # premier1k
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair the problem is apologies do n't help . results matter and it 's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that .

 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair is seriously t_up the t_up worst . i do n't remember the last time i or someone i knew had a flight that was n't delayed / cancelled flightled / etc !
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways i ca n't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive , forcing me to purchase a new ticket .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair yes . just sayin ' that was a particularly poorly handled situation .
 xbos xfld 1 @united i was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other cancelled flightlations .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair waited 34 mins for baggage t_up mdw > t_up mem and the in - flight service was suspended so no drink üòï
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue shut up an turn on the tvs / music
 xbos xfld 1 @united that 's unfortunate . the @tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
 xbos xfld 1 @united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline . you guys suck . # worst

 xbos xfld 1 @americanair is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $ 350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off ? flights from ...
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair it 's not only my bag ... it 's the complete lack of respect when i called . i was hung up on . and it is my daughters bag
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair - kind of early but any idea when dates through the first week of sept will come available ?
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that . go extinct . a merger only delays the inevitable

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways " we ca n't help you . we do n't put people up in hotels when you miss a flight it 's against policy . "
 xbos xfld 1 @united my last call your customer service agent called me back ... as he was stuck on hold to air canada .. just hope he 's booked me a flight
 xbos xfld 1 @united s tk_rep 4 o , it 's been 15 days and you 've offered no response . so i assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now ?
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair what 's done is done . not much you can do at this point . trip is already over .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair she has the guy u served drinks 2 til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair any possible chance of t_up swa bringing back service between t_up lga- t_up bwi ? it would make it much easier to connect to the west coast .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair worst customer service ever . you cancelled flightled my connecting flight to ny hours ago & & did n't tell me . now i 'm stuck in tampa .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair luggage delivery between 1 - 4am ? really ? after i was told by midnight multiple times ? why lie ? crazy and bad business .

 xbos xfld 1 @united thanks , i will !

 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue ok we got as far as atlantic city due to t_up jfk being closed . can you get us to t_up hpn or t_up lga ? ? please ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united i guess . but what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services ? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers . weather too ?
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue why did you just cancelled flight flight 670 last minute ? ! ?
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair though i work for another major airline , i t_up love your black history month commercial . i thank you .

 xbos xfld 1 @virginamerica current bug on website shows ‚Äò select departure city‚Äô when selecting destination city http : / / t.co / sllyibe2vq
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue that is a stock response . delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv & & being told by 3 ppl to wait & & they 'd come back but did not .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair just landed - crew could n't have been more gracious or accommodating . although a long delay i appreciate your prompt response !
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways question is why flight took off at all , now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair i have been trying to get through to someone about my cancelled flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours .
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue why would n't you just credit it right to my account instead of having a separate sign on . that seems pretty ridiculous .
 xbos xfld 1 @united flt 1583 t_up ewr to t_up sfo excellent service . friendly flight attendants . made the t_up 6 am flight a very good start to the day .
 xbos xfld 1 @united that was the problem . we were being told the aircraft was on its way .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair hey ! tried calling customer service and was told there 's a 2 hour wait . this has been for the past 4 hours . thanks ! you suck !
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue flight delayed 3x ( ! ) and still not taking off on time , & & greeting me at my seat ( yes it 's gum & & garbage ) : http : / / t.co / n9hmcrjchb
 xbos xfld 1 @virginamerica kinda sucked my earphone jack did n't work on my flight . they may want to look into that for future passengers
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue it 's not ideal , but it 's okay . better late flight than never ! :)
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from seattle to charlotte will have connections held ? or ...
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair --(pt 2 ) and the aa reservations phone number has been less than helpful , telling me to change things online when i ca n't .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways so how about some help with suggested time i could call to avoid such long wait time
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair why a different airport ! i have no way of getting to a different airport .
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue thanks ! i just sent a few dms .
 xbos xfld 1 .@americanair just disappointed with the flight booking problems process and add‚Äôl fees to sit together on a more crowded flight . not impressed so far : - / .

 xbos xfld 1 @americanair why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?

 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4 . now switched to carsl 5 . it 's comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period ? unacceptable .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair thank you for the confirmation .
 xbos xfld 1 @united how can i verify if wheelchair assistance has been requested for my next flight ?
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue wow you guys answer people wow you care i love jet blue
 xbos xfld 1 @united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure . there is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane !
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue on the plane now ! hopefully no longer at the mercy of the playlist ! thanks !
 xbos xfld 1 @united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow .
 xbos xfld 1 @united is officially the worst , most delayed , and least helpful airline i have ever had the misfortune of flying on
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways i ‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a flight attendant who is n‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler .
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue : ahoy from a loyal # allyoucanjetpass holder ! when do you anticipate direct us flights to # havana , # cuba ? ( # jetblue # vacation )

 xbos xfld 1 @united at this point i made it home on my own .
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue that 's what we 've been told however how would this work if you 're going overseas ? bottom line is passengers feel as if there 's ( 1 )
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue got txt 40min after sched dpt , saying plane had just arrived @ t_up jfk . late flightr txt w / dpt gate change . then 9:04 dpt for 7:40 flight .

 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair my rating for southwest -9 on s scale of 1 to 10
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours , then yeah .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair long mait . repair wait at gate - capt said " paperwork formality"- forced to check bag rudely - returning cc reader does n't work
 xbos xfld 1 @united it 's frustrating , as a frequent flyer , loyal since continental . upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair first time flying with you . you 've definitely won me over !
 xbos xfld 1 @united $ 25 united coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight , seriously ? # ridiculousness # learncustomerservice

 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair did you cancelled flight t_up all flights into t_up bna today ? ? ? # needtogethome
 xbos xfld 1 @united typical caned response from ua , fix your crappy performing , last placed / ranked airline in this century !
 xbos xfld 1 @united instead of making seats smaller / thinner so u can jam more people on a flight , u should concentrate on maint & & happy customers
 xbos xfld 1 @united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour , and then boarding us onto a flight that t_up reeks of vomit because it was n't cleaned properly
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways best part was hearing the attendant give a voucher to person next to me for hotel at t_up bgr . then my guy saying " we do n't do that "
 xbos xfld 1 @virginamerica @shrinerack seattle bound . wifey got me the duffle for vday . she 's a keeper ! ! ! holla ! ! ! http : / / t.co / jloiblnair

 xbos xfld 1 @united still no refund or word via dm . please resolve this issue as your cancelled flightled flight was useless to my assistant 's trip .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways flight is already over . i think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that t_up vape is still smoking
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways and , the helpful employee who changed her boarding zone so that she would have space for her pump is now being disciplined # fail
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways inexcusable behavior by gate agent . sorry is n't enough . # flight850 # t_up clt- # t_up bna
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways customer service failure aside , one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests . i 'm sure t_up tsa would .

 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue luggage fees ? wo n't b flying jb again ! at least # aa gives platinum pass 2 bags ! tired of overchging bg herded like cattle2slaughter
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair will do . i 'd think , though , that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update ?
 xbos xfld 1 really ? 9+hours tk_rep 4 ? @united : @jenniferwalshpr we do n't like delays and do all we can to avoid them . we 'll have you on your way t_up asap
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue incidentally , sheila at t_up jfk deserves a raise because she 's awesome .
 xbos xfld 1 @united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
 xbos xfld 1 @united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k / year deserve better service than a cc holder .
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue i am sharing it to the public . i fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll . your staff is the worst i ever met .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair stranded for 24 hours in t_up mia , patrick casimir has been the t_up only aa staff to apologize for the great inconvenience # unreal
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair really enjoying sitting at t_up bwi with the door wide open and the a / c on as they fix a " baggage error " # sarcasm
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue 1242 now ? ! i may cry !
 xbos xfld 1 @united i have a 0530 flight out of t_up dfw on tuesday . how far in advance will you give notice if cancelled flightled ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united t_up and my luggage has been broken ! ! # youcouldntmakethis up # brokenwheel
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately cancelled flighted to give her a tuesday morning flight ... no compensation . ugh
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair had a bad experience with them last week . they broke my bicycle that i had brought with me to do a bike ride in fla . why ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united involuntarily bumped your passenger and ca n't guarantee them another flight for three days !
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair sure is . what 's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair line of 100 + people to rebook at t_up mia now . virtual hold on rebook line just hangs up during call back . http : / / t.co / upaz1ef3dl
 xbos xfld 1 @virginamerica are flights leaving dallas for seattle on time feb 24 ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united thanks for your response . bags came , but it was a long wait and priority tags were n't honored at all . disappointing

 xbos xfld 1 wanted to get my bag benefit , but instead get $ 25 pricing on all three tickets . when adding a card , mp visa is only option . @united
 xbos xfld 1 @united i hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
 xbos xfld 1 @united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... how about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane ! ! !
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour . unacceptable . you have a complete disregard for customer service .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today ... this usually does n't happen ...
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair tell me you can get me to t_up abi earlier than 8 pm tomorrow
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue when i got your alert , i immediately started looking to rebook . but we only had 11 minutes from reflight booking problems to catch a flight to t_up srq .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair hi ! just got my t_up tsa pre - check # & & put it in my acct . but it 's not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.can it be updated ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united thank you for the speedy response ! i figured it may be something of that nature . you guys and your " fine print , " haha
 xbos xfld 1 @united i 'll be impressed if i actually get a response ! üòú
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways i do n't mind waiting , i mind waiting on a plane , when i should n't have had to . the airport has more room and you know .. food !
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue thanks ! i only loose 'em at airports ... 1st time we found it . i think @fitbit needs to make flexes that stay on when carrying bags !
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair just want the money i paid for early bird refunded . noone seemed to be able at three different . sw should have that worked out
 xbos xfld 1 @united returned from vacation + went to luggage services . golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could 've been used in the first place .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways 3rd time cut off after 10 + minutes on hold with chairmans desk ? ! ? ? ? wth how are we supposed to rebook cancelled flightled flights ? ! ? ! ?
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue gotcha ... but " lessening the delay " ... that part 's not happening , right ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united not to belabor my point , but should n't i be able to put a laptop bag above my seat ? why is it announced to leave it for rollers ? thx
 xbos xfld 1 @united can you help 689 in chicago get to a gate . freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9 pm
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways your " moveup " policy really sucks . united has a 24 hour policy for this with status . i was wanting to move up from 5 am to 7 am ...
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways after today , no reason 4 anyone to not approve merger with @americanair , other airlines have no reason to fear losing business to u
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways they told me to call back late flightr
 xbos xfld 1 @united of course i did . the bag should be here by now :( # frustrated
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair we 've already made other arrangements ourselves .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair thank you for the vouchers after the long wait on the runway saturday night at t_up bwi ! i really appreciate it ! # swfan

 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair great news for @portcolumbuscmh today . finally , columbus ' top unserved market will have flights .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways yep , except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done . # fail .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways and really , it 's a middle initial versus middle name . all else the same . not spending my time on your computer issues .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair- ... was only less than 3500pts , but it helped . had partnerrewards incoming , but not fast enough to keep pts from expiring .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways i would appreciate a call regarding a t_up horrible experience i had with a gate agent . was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways would love to combine aa and usair accts . unfortunately , one has my middle name & & one has middle initial . wo n't allow change
 xbos xfld 1 @united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat i did n't want , all while not even notifying me . great 1k service üëé
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair aww cool ! it 's nice to know they are still up above my head then . one of my faves .

 xbos xfld 1 @united out of curiosity , when a flight is arranged , are pilots notified ? there are a lot of " pilots have n't arrived yet " announcements .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair when will the flight resume ? i don 's see it in the open schedule . : /
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever . 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting

 xbos xfld 1 @americanair what are we going to do about the nightmare you guys out me through yesterday ? zero response from the tweet you last sent me .
 xbos xfld 1 @united i see you guys are at it again . amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways already did it . one person said they could n't do anything another said she did n't know why the first person we talked 2 said that
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue hard when you 're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane . we should get better than this
 xbos xfld 1 @united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at t_up ewr ? been waiting for bags for 1 hr . united = overcharged&&underserved

 xbos xfld 1 @usairways already filed a report personally at the airport , however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways what does " your reservation is ' out of sync . ' " mean ? on hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair so am i going to be homeless or do i have a place to stay tonight ? can you respond to me here so i can go back to sleep ?
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a sailor dealing with a death in the family

 xbos xfld 1 .thnx for the response @united bot . it seems this ' improvement ' could be easily attained . is your 1st class service really only worth $ 50 ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united @maxabrahms * if * he needs assistance ? do you expect him to go on a scooby doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff ?
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours . this is insane . every other flight has made it to t_up nyc .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair now flight is book and i have to fly standby if they will allow me to check in before the flight takes off
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways thank you !
 xbos xfld 1 @united your staff , both on deck and in the cabin on t_up ua768 t_up sfo - > t_up bos were exceptional today . please tell them well done :)
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair got back eventually ! was a rollercoaster . once i got to the airport & & got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there . american is a hurting brand
 xbos xfld 1 @united make sure you make cancelled flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
 xbos xfld 1 @united just added one . ty
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair what 's up with the wait times on your customer service line ? tried 2x on fri . and now i 've been on for over 15 min .
 xbos xfld 1 @usairways so apparently all of your computers crashed at t_up bwi ? any update on when flights will be moving ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united i believe just customer service . at last post he was at narita in tokyo . they sent him to a motel to rest . said standby maybe 2days
 xbos xfld 1 @united # unitedairlines wo nt wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting . flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today

 xbos xfld 1 @virginamerica any way to change from main cabin to main cabin select ( on same flight ) without paying a change fee penalty ?
 xbos xfld 1 @jetblue they say they have no update . i do n't work i do n't get paid . jet blue has my money but no flight . argh !
 xbos xfld 1 @united kudos for not cancelled flightling flights from t_up dfw this morning . united usually first to panic ...

 xbos xfld 1 @americanair when flight booking problems an int'l flight online , do i have to provide a passport number when flight booking problems or just when i arrive at airport ?
 xbos xfld 1 @united t_up everytime i fly ur airline i hate you even more ! thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
 xbos xfld 1 @united strikes again ! why board anyone if there 's something wrong with the plane ? common sense .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair # horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours . i 'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight i want is still there late flightr .
 xbos xfld 1 @united maybe be hiring your own ground staff at t_up lax when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be . t_up hopeless
 xbos xfld 1 @united ticket counter masters out of t_up smf not very helpful .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair can you help

 xbos xfld 1 @united hmmm ... seems like this could be something to be changed to be more # flyerfriendly .
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair @nickcunningham1 except now there is no wait time , the phone system just hangs up on you . so continuing to hold wo n't help .
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair thanks for an awesome flight and connection ! we were delayed but your staff and crew were purely amazing !
 xbos xfld 1 @americanair yes , for tomorrow at 9 am . but i have to work though üòí i 'm really mad about the situation

 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair you rerouted my bf 's flight and he 's diabetic with little insulin ; even though we tried to change it , the agent would n't do it
 xbos xfld 1 @southwestair yep after two hours and thirty minutes
