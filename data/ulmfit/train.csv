1,"@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them."
-1,@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
-1,@SouthwestAir Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate.
1,@JetBlue offers hot tea and coffee...at the gate! You guys make me wonder why I have ever flown any other airlines! ‚òï‚úàüëç
-1,@usairways 2 people working the counter at #dca? Massive lines. Poorly played. #winterstorm

-1,@AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry
-1,"@united yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me."
-1,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
-1,@VirginAmerica Because we never rec'd Cancelled Flightlation notice we were left w no options to fly out of PS. Driving to LA for a red eye Mon w kids
1,@SouthwestAir great example of customer service this morning at MSY headed to ATL. Alison and Bobbi were fantastic! Gate B8. Thank you.
-1,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
-1,"@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information."
0,@virginamerica spruce moose!
-1,@united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN!
-1,@USAirways if I try and call your reservations line will someone answer the phone now or will I be on hold for an hour again?
-1,@AmericanAir What are we going to do about the nightmare you guys out me through yesterday? Zero response from the tweet you last sent me.
-1,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
-1,@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
0,@SouthwestAir can you speed up your flight from AZ to Omaha? I need to see muh boy ‚úàÔ∏è
-1,@united customer service what's That???
-1,"@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you"
1,@JetBlue Seems a few of my friends speak highly as well. Now we just need to find a decent priced way to go from YVR to SEA and overnight.
0,@united lets see of we can do this today! Hoping for an on-time dept #dullestostatecollege #runningonthreehoursofsleep #delayedovernight
-1,@USAirways already did it. One person said they couldn't do anything another said she didn't know why the first person we talked 2 said that
-1,@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
-1,@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
1,@JetBlue thanks for your reply. It was flight 1572.
-1,"@SouthwestAir BTW I was completely unable to buy wifi for my flight using Galaxy S4. Couldn't zoom out or scroll to touch ""Buy"""
-1,@USAirways please respond to me. I've been on hold on the reservations line for an hour and 45 minutes. I would really appreciate it.
-1,@JetBlue But jet blue had Cancelled Flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it.
0,@JetBlue ok is I hope thy the Bahamas next
-1,@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
1,@JetBlue thank you! I'm excited to fly with you for the first time.
0,"@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood all are great , but I have to go with #CarrieUnderwood üòçüëå"
-1,"@USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number."
-1,"@USAirways what does ""your reservation is 'out of sync.'"" mean? On hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up"
-1,@AmericanAir so am I going to be homeless or do I have a place to stay tonight? Can you respond to me here so I can go back to sleep?
-1,@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
1,"@AmericanAir ""Airport snow removal method #22...""
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/oUmC1LrXDN"
0,.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
-1,@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
-1,@JetBlue why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC.
0,@SouthwestAir now flight is book and I have to fly standby if they will allow me to check in before the flight takes off
1,@USAirways thank you!
1,"@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -&gt; BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)"
1,@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
-1,@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
-1,@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
0,@united just added one. Ty
-1,@SouthwestAir What's up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I've been on for over 15 min.
-1,@USAirways so apparently all of your computers crashed at BWI?  Any update on when flights will be moving?
-1,@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
0,@united #UnitedAirlines wont wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today
0,@SouthwestAir @SwagglikeBean take me here
0,@AmericanAir With snow/ice forecast DFW Tu pm-We am what is change policy on reservations we hold Wed morning? Any leeway??
0,@JetBlue I have more flights that I'd love to redeem for some points but they're a little over a year old. Is there a historical limit?
-1,@JetBlue hopefully this flight Seattle to Boston 2pm will have wifi. Our first one did not and we had to entertain ourselves! #lizaapproved
-1,"@AmericanAir way to ruin a vacation, my brother has called all night and had multiple places in line only to get dead air on call back"
0,@JetBlue Hey guys do you have a tail number assigned yet to flight 1373 for tomorrow?
0,@virginamerica Any way to change from Main Cabin to Main Cabin Select (on same flight) without paying a change fee penalty?
-1,@JetBlue they say they have no update. I don't work I don't get paid.  Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh!
1,@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
0,@united dm these nuts
1,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
0,Need more info on that! @united: @momsgoodeats We have great amenity kits. PJ's not included. We status match AA. ^KP‚Äù
-1,@united Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.
0,@jetblue that's cause we're TrueBlue! It's ur #love that keeps liftin' me #higherandhigher https://t.co/xGfS6tJTMo http://t.co/ixM3t5mIZc
0,@SouthwestAir Can I do the same thing as changing a ticket by Cancelled Flighting my current ticket &amp; buying a replacement online?
1,"@SouthwestAir  THANK YOU for your awesome flights. Sweetheart got screwed on @FlyFrontier, managed to scramble and get a SW plane today. !!!"
0,@USAirways do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday morning.
0,@united can you help me add my KTN to this reservation PLZ?
-1,@AmericanAir especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...Thanks
-1,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
0,"@AmericanAir When Flight Booking Problems an int'l flight online, do I have to provide a passport number when Flight Booking Problems or just when I arrive at airport?"
-1,@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
-1,@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
-1,@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers
-1,@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
-1,@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
-1,@United ticket counter Masters out of SMF not very helpful.
0,@SouthwestAir can you help
1,@JetBlue thanks JB!! This is why I üíô you!
1,@USAirways experience exceptional service from Cherry at #DenverAirport.  #GreatService. #professionalism
-1,@SouthwestAir while you clearly didn't care about our troubles yday thought I'd share bags took &gt;90min and came back absolutely drenched..
1,@united Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more #flyerfriendly.
-1,"@AmericanAir @nickcunningham1 Except now there is no wait time, the phone system just hangs up on you. So continuing to hold won't help."
1,@SouthwestAir thanks for an awesome flight and connection! We were delayed but your staff and crew were purely amazing!
-1,"@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though üòí I'm really mad about the situation"
0,@SouthwestAir @Vindictive_tK Larry David works for southwest?
-1,"@SouthwestAir You rerouted my bf's flight and he's diabetic with little insulin; even though we tried to change it, the agent wouldn't do it"
-1,@SouthwestAir yep after two hours and thirty minutes
-1,"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"
-1,@JetBlue what's up w flt 4? Brothers fianc√© sitting on board for 30mins w tech  issues.
-1,@USAirways agent won't hold for connection arriving Late Flight. 7 min before departure time but 3 min too Late Flight. Flt 1903 gate c19. Disappointed
0,@united obviously
-1,@USAirways more than an hour holding to change a flight on the phone now.. What's up with that???
-1,@united Friend at O'Hare and can't get on flight bc they say no proof he bought 1st class tkt. He has boarding pass.
0,@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
-1,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
1,@united thnx!

0,@AmericanAir hi when will your next set of flights be out for next year from Dublin???
-1,@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
