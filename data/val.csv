12945;-1;@AmericanAir after waiting for a delayed plane, we sat on the plane for an hour waiting for a Late Flight passenger. That's BS too..

8367;0;@JetBlue For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would love a birthday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines.

1920;1;@united Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back.
82;-1;@VirginAmerica you're the best!! Whenever I (begrudgingly) use any other airline I'm delayed and Late Flight :(
7331;-1;@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
7304;1;@JetBlue Ok. Thanks for your help.
816;-1;@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
11347;-1;"@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you."

4120;-1;@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
11651;0;@USAirways - I'm in the Cust Svc line.  Your Charlotte, NC agents better be in their A game.
12992;0;@AmericanAir what's the best number to use?
1813;-1;@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
1271;-1;@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.
8751;0;@JetBlue I have the emails that they are on their way
2994;-1;@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
11149;-1;@USAirways @americanair I feel sorry for AA
6409;1;@SouthwestAir Glad it was finally resolved too. Too bad I can't get a free voucher to go with mine so I can have a friend travel next time!
13069;-1;@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
2642;-1;@united where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost
9280;0;@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
13370;1;@AmericanAir Huge thanks for fixing our flights! appreciate the customer service. now if only i could get seats assigned: me next to my wife
2305;-1;@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost
10662;-1;@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
12265;-1;@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
4195;-1;"@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened"

3554;-1;@united @staralliance the B gates are very far though
2195;-1;@united you're terrible.
2600;-1;@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
6163;-1;@SouthwestAir we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
1518;1;@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
12738;-1;@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
10731;-1;@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
6309;-1;@SouthwestAir why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes?
5755;1;@SouthwestAir was fantastic! That's the best flight service I've ever had.
5633;0;@SouthwestAir how oh how do we get tickets! ?!
8399;1;@JetBlue I was so excited when I saw that you fly there! #ionlyflyblue
13631;-1;@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
7162;1;@JetBlue @BrandsSayingBae well here we go
12473;-1;@AmericanAir I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances.
11699;-1;@USAirways is anyone working today?? Anyone want to pick up a phone?
1988;-1;@united help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded?

11979;-1;@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings

6547;-1;@SouthwestAir Thank you - hung up after 1hr 7min on hold. Would you like me to DM you contact info?
4855;-1;@SouthwestAir no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar.

49;0;@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood All were entertaining
14492;-1;@AmericanAir The point of the pic: If your reps struggle with the merger this much, imagine how it is for the public! http://t.co/hQdB5IRuVg
887;-1;@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
6261;-1;@SouthwestAir now it's delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse

8708;-1;@JetBlue People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight.
3168;-1;@united any solutions?
2949;0;@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
1424;-1;@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away
139;-1;@VirginAmerica why can't we book seats on your flights when we buy them or even during check in? Creates so much anxiety! #frustrated
3197;-1;@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
5131;0;@SouthwestAir 20 passengers on this plane. I should've just grabbed my baggage and gave it its own seat.

12707;-1;@AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!
4559;-1;@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
4595;0;@SouthwestAir New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/iQnVyFPg4P
4690;-1;@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
7951;1;@JetBlue yes! Terra blue chips were my favorite. :)
10926;-1;@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!
3277;-1;@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute.
4068;-1;@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
4408;-1;@SouthwestAir nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points?
10373;-1;@USAirways not happy w/ app Late Flightly. Last time I flew wouldn't let me check in, This time I checked in went on Late Flightr says I never checked in
12573;-1;@AmericanAir they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
9729;0;@USAirways Can you help with a seat assignment?  5 people flight 694, PHX to HNL, seats are split up.  Anything you can do will be great.
451;1;@VirginAmerica I am all about the in flight artisanal cheese and wine pairing.
7262;1;@JetBlue thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward
3731;-1;@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
7256;-1;@JetBlue Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail.
13112;-1;@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too
4986;-1;@SouthwestAir could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved?
3663;-1;"@united It was quite enjoyable. üòä 

Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. üòï"
2763;0;@united (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too).  I think they might really need this. Any ideas?
8850;0;@JetBlue is bag check cut off 30 minutes before the original departure time or the estimated time shown online?
10768;-1;@USAirways there is a travel advis for nyc and phil PA  -winter weather- but U.S. Air hasn't posted one yet. Can I still change flt wo pen?

2240;-1;@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
13388;1;@AmericanAir although there was a 6 hour delay every single staff member from the ticket desk to the admirals club in was as sweet as pie
8112;-1;"@JetBlue This is the error message: Paper tickets cannot be serviced on-line.

2972;0;@united what do I do if something is missing from my checked baggage?
6871;0;@JetBlue its domestic I just wanted more of an idea so I don't get surprised.
11038;-1;@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE.

13377;-1;@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold
1907;-1;@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr

10615;0;@USAirways So no idea? Thanks...
9653;-1;@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
7432;1;@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock

3426;0;@united I have already emailed but I didn't know if it was more expedient to contact you here. Please advise. Thanks.
11222;-1;@usairways hey just letting you know you're the worst fucking service I've ever used thanks for nothing
1381;-1;@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
11429;1;@USAirways she also appreciated having her very own hashtag! :) #lucycat
8605;-1;@JetBlue extra-speed line closed in Tampa. What gives?
7427;-1;@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA‚úàÔ∏èBOS

3175;-1;@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
12466;-1;@AmericanAir what's the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
11676;1;@USAirways thanks
8448;1;@JetBlue Jua at JFK 'Just Ask' desk was incredibly helpful! Thanks!
14495;-1;@AmericanAir wasn't able to get on hold. Your system kept kicking me to the main menu.
11600;-1;@USAirways Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour
2235;0;@united is there another airport closer to Calgary we can fly out of tomorrow.
8068;0;@JetBlue I did. They said not as of now. Let's cross fingers it happens before departing
9959;-1;@USAirways thanks for being so bad you make a two day train trip look appealing!!
4236;-1;"@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept"
10857;-1;@USAirways I just want to find my bag so I won't have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail
11198;-1;@USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.
9764;-1;"@USAirways your rude staff said"" I don't care that we are out of market place food you're going on vacation and I have to work"" nice huh"
24;-1;@VirginAmerica you guys messed up my seating.. I reserved seating with my friends and you guys gave my seat away ... üò° I want free internet
3363;-1;@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.
1088;-1;The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.

10503;-1;@USAirways Been tweeting with the team at @AmericanAir who informed me that the problem is that you never sent his bags to them yesterday.
7537;-1;@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures
7470;-1;@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
13650;-1;@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that...
4152;-1;@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
9501;0;@USAirways @HutchinsJim Yes, I made the flight and got my workout in too.
695;1;@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
13445;-1;@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!
6337;1;@SouthwestAir Thanks for the info! Have a good day.

2953;-1;@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
3637;1;@united is officially my favorite airline. They have created magic for me all day!!! #friendlyskies #careyon
3906;-1;@united is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don't even know where it is!
4778;0;@SouthwestAir got an email confirmation of wifi purchase on a recent flight. Trouble is, I've never flown with you. Ever. #concerned #scam?
5845;1;@SouthwestAir nvm, gate said they're holding connections. Thanks for quick response!
14198;1;@AmericanAir ok, thanks you! Have a great night AA team!
4117;0;@united no thanks
11086;0;@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates
1137;-1;"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
2767;-1;@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
8182;-1;@JetBlue yes of course, before I left the airport. I kept looking but claim is still open.

10880;-1;@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
2490;-1;@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
14176;-1;@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?
7742;0;@JetBlue thanks. Can you change the music in the boarding gates?
3935;0;@united Thanks. UA1121, DEN, 40 min on tarmac.
2384;0;@united we have developers flying down tmrw morn. w/45 min layover, there is an earlier flight to have 1.5hr layover, can move them up?
8016;1;@JetBlue messaged you, thanks
7084;1;@JetBlue toss this ticket...it's great PR and I'm sure every college student following me will be willing to rock out wit too üëÄüëÄ
115;-1;"@VirginAmerica should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a ""tech stop""?"
1863;-1;@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming
3119;-1;@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
4258;1;@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
13519;-1;@AmericanAir I'm trying to register since 12:00,don't want to be separated from my brother during the15hours flight!There're few places left
12388;1;@AmericanAir Thanks, have emailed them. How long should I expect for a response?
2819;1;‚Äú@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP‚Äù THANK YOU!  United Cares!
11158;-1;@USAirways thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline.
10987;1;@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå
13310;-1;@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighting my flight today because of weather in Dallas without being charged?
4699;0;@SouthwestAir need assistance getting an extension on a flight that has expired.
3802;-1;@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
6068;-1;"@SouthwestAir Flt 463 San Jose, CA -&gt; Denver, CO. Delayed 2 hrs but easily best flight + touchdown in all my years flying. Keep it up!"
3536;-1;@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag...
3825;-1;@united Learn to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate
6642;0;@SouthwestAir I am following you now. I don't think I can DM until you follow me.
13714;-1;@AmericanAir bag turned up, no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website
1946;-1;@united fuck you for not caring üò¢
12785;-1;@AmericanAir my Mistake multibillion dollar company
11169;0;@USAirways  I have a party of 4 booked for a flight in Aug. At 10:05am, how can I find out how much it would cost to change to an earlier fl
12205;0;@AmericanAir i want to change my flight for next week, they will still charge me. Waiting for fligt status
9802;-1;@USAirways hire smarter IT people if your systems keep crashing instead of some of the mooks you man some of these airports with. #goDelta
7269;-1;@JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
11422;-1;@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
7929;0;@JetBlue üò≠ I used points can I get them back if I decide not to go?
7166;1;@JetBlue Hopefully now my application for JetBlue donut designer will finally go through the proper channels.
6963;0;@JetBlue everyone is overreacting. Keep up your swag!
5867;1;@SouthwestAir ok, gotcha! ‚úàÔ∏èüòÉüëç
4761;-1;@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
10386;-1;@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
882;1;@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
557;-1;@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
11874;-1;@USAirways I have been on hold with your Gold reservations line for OVER 3 HOURS now. Flight Cancelled Flightled. Trying to rebook.
1207;-1;@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
11089;1;@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
7684;1;@JetBlue thank you
11313;1;@USAirways ice cream up front! Solid
9702;-1;@USAirways - is stranding your customers, not reFlight Booking Problems them, and then not answering the phone the way you treat Platinum members?
6538;0;@SouthwestAir what is DM?
10485;1;@USAirways No Problem - he was the only person in the airport who would help :)
3211;0;@united your flights are really cheap what's the catch
3630;-1;@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..
1708;-1;@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
12078;-1;@AmericanAir submitted a case to AA customer relations two weeks ago, no word ever since! whats the point of even having CR?
8458;-1;"@JetBlue My mother had overheard a personnel ask the attendant if ""the passengers really knew what was going on"" and the attendant said no."
1140;-1;"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"

6207;0;@SouthwestAir App Updated With #Passbook Support http://t.co/WrWqrUblPs via @ubergizmo
14141;-1;@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
3730;1;@united Just did, thanks for checking! :)
10101;-1;@USAirways worse experience. Clt to DC. Oversold by 20, lost CARRY ON luggage.Cancelled Flightled connecting flight to NYC. #flydelta
11311;-1;@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
2660;-1;@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
8848;-1;"@JetBlue Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then ""mailbox has not been set up yet."" Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C'mon"
1307;-1;@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...

9190;-1;@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
2834;-1;@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach
14014;-1;@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
9429;-1;@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box.
2151;0;@united traveling with 3 young kids!! Chose our original flights for a reason.
11419;-1;@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?

10378;-1;@USAirways weather doesn't excuse poor customer service, lack of info from staff or the fact staff haven't turned up
9326;-1;@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
5004;0;@SouthwestAir check the head of the plane, there has been dynamite placed onto it
6626;-1;"@SouthwestAir also, they said they couldn't even book the flight. They were having to put me on hold &amp; have someone else do it???"

9748;-1;@USAirways 1st flight with U.S. Air Plane had mechanical issues. Wait 90 minutes for help from customer service. No help from management
382;0;@VirginAmerica I need a receipt for a flight change. Can you send one?
11028;1;@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!

13614;-1;@AmericanAir Thank you for the worst experience ever on an airline, from me to you, I hope your embarrassed as an airline. Pathetic
1439;0;@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
9569;-1;@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying..

5498;-1;@SouthwestAir alist pref doesn't do any good if direct to atl is always wifiless. Flight 1701.
4916;-1;@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
8556;-1;@JetBlue Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended!
1932;-1;@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
2352;-1;@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care

13442;1;@AmericanAir thank you!
4154;0;@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?

6789;1;@JetBlue wouldn't mind paying for the snacks but no $ for tix :-) Great job guys!
8036;1;@JetBlue heading to Buffalo... trading the cold in Boston for colder in Buffalo... Maybe the Caribbean next time?
8315;-1;@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
13862;-1;"@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?"
5668;0;@SouthwestAir how do I go on the scavenger hunt if I'm in Boston?
2172;-1;"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."

6268;-1;@SouthwestAir Service rep didn't say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it.
2309;0;@united - it is possible to make a ticket change via Twitter? Traveling internationally and can't make calls... Thanks in advance!

6591;-1;@SouthwestAir good thing we noticed because she had re-routed 7 total passengers on an impossible triple connection as well
4458;-1;@SouthwestAir Why, when I booked via phone after calling the A List preferred #, didn't my KTA get added to the ticket??? Must I use web?

3699;1;@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)
929;-1;@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage‚Ä¶ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
6468;-1;@SouthwestAir bos to msp, msp to aus, aus to bos. Site doesn't seem to display fields for the middle trip when I add the 3rd.
8767;1;@JetBlue I will try that. Thanks! If all else fails I will just do the old fashioned method tomorrow morning.
