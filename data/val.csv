9814;-1;@USAirways That's 1h 10m waiting to get my bag, 1h40m of flight delays, plus the 2hrs of delay I had on the way out. Never flying you again.
3722;1;@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough
307;1;@VirginAmerica I mean. Probably inappropriate while on board.. But, it's on!
4589;0;@SouthwestAir honesty should always be the policy

3094;-1;@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient
7298;-1;@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?
4478;1;@SouthwestAir bumped me to preboard on both flights (because I'm fat?) Whatever the reason, thanks!
2991;-1;@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation

3658;1;"@united 
I will admit, you've been rather good to me over the years.
You've still got me hooked.
