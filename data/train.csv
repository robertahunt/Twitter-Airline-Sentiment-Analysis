8322;-1;@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept.
12543;0;@AmericanAir we then had to deplane, and change planes.

13710;0;@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?

14329;-1;@AmericanAir 250 I'm not sure if I'm rebooked now. In a line at airport trying to work it out. The earlier I can get to SFO the better:(
8644;1;@JetBlue had a great flight to Orlando from Hartford a few weeks ago! Was great to get out on time and arrive early!
8568;0;@JetBlue I can't pay 30 bucks xD
7545;-1;@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
4996;-1;@SouthwestAir No like I said I could not reach anyone at your company so I had to rent a car and chalk the whole thing up to a loss
7412;1;@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!

6332;-1;@SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate

8960;0;@JetBlue really caring??
2594;-1;@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
13498;0;@AmericanAir is DFW accepting any arrivals or departures today?
11913;1;@AmericanAir This is exactly why ill be flying AA from @Dulles_Airport to Dallas! Only airline I trust!

1216;-1;@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way
6400;1;@SouthwestAir Got it covered. Thanks!
13423;-1;@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology
382;0;@VirginAmerica I need a receipt for a flight change. Can you send one?
7638;0;@JetBlue  I see my flight from Boston to Pitts is ok from this afternoon. Did you have any delays for the morning flight?
11506;0;@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
8095;1;That would be great! I never thought I'd be the sort who'd be into them, but it really makes the flying experience more bearable @JetBlue
7714;1;@JetBlue OK, thank you.
3833;-1;@united on your website it says 10 days. Its been 16 and counting.
12653;0;@AmericanAir What are Preferred Seats?

8900;-1;"@JetBlue, I normally ‚ù§Ô∏è you, but this Late Flightst flight experience was the worst. 2 hours on runway, no wifi &amp; tv not working properly"

4958;1;@SouthwestAir ohk. Thank You!!! B/C of the inexpensive airfares that Southwest has I can now travel around.
4660;0;@SouthwestAir done. Sorry, I thought I was already.

9993;-1;@USAirways according to @wtop DCA seems to be recovering nicely from yesterday's snow so why are you Cancelled Flightling flights out there?
10645;-1;@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
7788;0;@JetBlue Yup. MCO. 82¬∞!!

14349;-1;@AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.
4519;0;@SouthwestAir Please lower my plane flight by like $100 bucks!! Thanks~ #FloridaVacation
11791;1;@USAirways thank you! I tried that and they said they didn't have it. Anywhere else to try?
12109;-1;@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this.
13582;-1;@AmericanAir all I want is to know what to do regarding my connecting flights since my 1st is Cancelled Flightled. Could you be of assistance?
4461;1;@SouthwestAir is the best airline hands down. Amazing customer service, bags free and affordable flights. #happycamper
13074;-1;@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis
9912;0;@USAirways I saw online you had fee but I was wondering if there was a way to pay for it ahead of time, instead of at the kiosk
7038;1;@JetBlue true. Maybe. Wish I had expedited security haha
10221;1;"@USAirways job well done from your Philly employee running check,in today. (Tabitha?) helped us in an emergency &amp; vacation saved!!!"

9330;-1;@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
4208;1;@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
6884;-1;@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?

12360;1;@AmericanAir Thank you for being so responsive on Twitter. Truly impressive.
12397;-1;@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.

7831;1;@JetBlue Kudos to JetBlue social media team for jumping in an helping me out during the last snow storm while web site was down..Thanks!!
3185;-1;@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
270;0;@VirginAmerica way to take advantage of #MayweatherPacquiao :)
13649;-1;@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
4818;1;@SouthwestAir Thanks for helping my mom after @allegiantair wouldn't let her get on her plane in Orlando! You're the best! #customerservice

11184;0;@USAirways if you've got room on an earlier flight home, why charge me $75 to get on it? Be the hero!
4038;0;@united reinstating the kosher meals that were dropped shortly after the merger?
11383;-1;@USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...

10478;0;@USAirways what about AA miles for USAir flights booked through American?
758;1;@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
10643;1;@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
5573;0;@SouthwestAir I saw ppl were winning tickets still, how do we win some?

5830;0;@SouthwestAir DM Sent.
5840;0;@SouthwestAir you're going to compensate us for the two plane changes in Atlanta right?
12156;1;@AmericanAir thanks!
11780;0;@USAirways Darn it, first in line for no upgrade! Wish I understood the policy. :) http://t.co/xGPaAyFDwt
1037;1;"@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back."

2610;-1;"@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off."
14293;-1;@AmericanAir a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely.

10486;0;@USAirways Okee doke
13040;-1;@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?
11261;1;@USAirways - done :)
7390;0;@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
5717;-1;@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
13094;-1;@AmericanAir On hold since 5am. When no one can get to the airport, Cancelled Flight flight, don't make us pay huge fee to change flight.
4229;-1;@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home.
1864;1;@united thank you
101;-1;@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax
9182;-1;@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
933;1;@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
118;1;"@VirginAmerica your beautiful front-end design is down right now; but it was cool to still book my ticket b/c all your back-end was secure."
6935;1;Stop. Please. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/EUl6sDURbU
9255;-1;@USAirways should, but didn‚Äôt.
11900;-1;@AmericanAir your planes made me miss 2 connections in 2 days. Thanks for nothing
13847;0;@AmericanAir I already landed! But, if you still care it was 1891. Thanks for the help though!, do you k ow what caused the failure?
4626;0;@SouthwestAir Dang, if only practice was an hour Late Flightr today...
11071;-1;@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
8504;0;@JetBlue client is asking if kids need their own email addresses to get TB acct. Is this true?
995;-1;@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
4459;-1;@SouthwestAir: Tried for VIP Live in The Vineyard but yr site went down, by the time I got in 2 redeem pts those packages gone.
12388;1;@AmericanAir Thanks, have emailed them. How long should I expect for a response?
5917;1;@SouthwestAir I was just sitting here talking at a tech conference about how awesome you guys are and this rolled across. Luv you guys! #LOL
6125;0;@SouthwestAir I will be writing in about the service via email. My company also transports well over 100 clients monthly via SW.
7171;1;@JetBlue Definitely! Lots of announcements and the app is great.
13969;-1;@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
1302;-1;@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
6210;0;@SouthwestAir Any possible chance of SWA bringing back service between LGA-BWI? It would make it much easier to connect to the west coast.
4608;0;@SouthwestAir How many tickets are left?
