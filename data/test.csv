372;-1;@VirginAmerica currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation?
2191;0;@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
3006;-1;@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
12138;1;@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
10507;-1;@USAirways looking forward to waiting on hold for 9 hrs to reschedule my flight.  Bunch of idiots work for this airline.

10115;-1;"@USAirways @ALfamilyoffour maybe if there was anyone answering the phone they would. ""Please call back Late Flightr"".For 18 hours? Not good enough"
13022;0;@AmericanAir Considering it was past midnight, I hung up and called again to receive another service call.
2958;0;@united please arrange someone at the arriving gate of flight 5957 to Chicago for either a refund or first class upgrade

5454;0;@SouthwestAir - did SWA send out customer surveys to earn $100 toward flights? Is this legit?
3281;-1;@united would be hard to be worse than last time but I'm sure you'll give it a shot
4271;0;@united thank you!!!!! And next flight to Durango then driving to Farmington New Mexico for work! But hitting the slopes in Durango!
