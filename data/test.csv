7327;-1;@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
7622;-1;@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ
987;-1;"@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable"
10658;-1;@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
2852;-1;@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day.
11695;-1;@USAirways This flight was for my brother. He has been rebooked and I was able to give my info over the phone to get him a pass to the Club.

13366;0;@AmericanAir I meant can you use the 50k bonus sign up mileage for Alaska flights or only American?
4445;-1;@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.
11608;0;@USAirways me too. Me too.
2137;-1;@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?
6787;-1;@JetBlue Is there an issue with your website and logging on? (App too?) I know I am entering info correctly but cannot sign in! :(
10828;-1;@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
9873;-1;@USAirways flight 2031, worst experience we've ever had on a flight. Regretting opening their air miles card #hotterandlongerthanhell
14275;0;@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight previous request. Will accept ticket number for document number
12459;-1;@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy

963;-1;@united this is atrocious customer service.
6012;0;@SouthwestAir is it possible to book a refundable trip? Willing to pay extra. This would be for a domestic round trip flight
4882;-1;@SouthwestAir You've inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit
140;-1;@VirginAmerica You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame
12046;-1;@AmericanAir sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM.
13224;-1;@AmericanAir Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us.

13896;-1;@AmericanAir  having trouble getting rebooked
3216;-1;@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
3814;-1;@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way
8321;-1;@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
12574;1;@AmericanAir thanks  you always be my airline of choice when possible
2278;-1;@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.

10246;-1;@USAirways forgot to call in the copilot so we're stuck on the plane in PHL. Looking fwd to being stranded in CLT. Day 2 of flight fails.
2430;-1;@united yes refund my ticket and give me email address to let u know what happened
8442;-1;@JetBlue Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today.
12398;-1;@AmericanAir again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i'm on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that
9299;-1;@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
3389;-1;@united Case ID 8544484
9905;0;@USAirways But good luck getting there! Not cool.
3911;0;@united volumes, profit up http://t.co/pKfI9bTtzf #aviation #aircargo http://t.co/BBj6kMTYUl
5383;-1;@SouthwestAir on hold for over an hour twice?  Terrible.
8907;1;@JetBlue @JayVig @roxydigital awww ^_^ R to the T, realtime appreciation from JetBlue #rockingthetweets #JVMChat
552;1;@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer.
9631;-1;@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again.
10462;-1;"@USAirways I did. They told me it was a 40 min wait &amp; they'd call back. It's already been 45 min. Horrible"
3144;0;@united I have a LH return business ticket from Den to Fra.If I fly domestic with you,bag can be checked through to Fra,no need to claim?
6917;1;"@JetBlue Not trying to make you look bad, on your website it says: ""Due to weather in the Charleston, NC"" Its actually in SC, not NC"
2056;-1;@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
1925;-1;"@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K"
634;-1;@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
6082;-1;@SouthwestAir humor aside, we've been stuck on the plane for two hours at the gate because bags can't be loaded correctly. What gives?
8508;-1;@JetBlue Tried...considerable confusion...no announcement...no sign updates
13585;-1;@AmericanAir a school trip of 38 including myself had to sleep over in the airport and are all on different standby flights.This is not good
14175;-1;@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
8619;-1;@JetBlue ask @j_beatz247 but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers.
12581;-1;@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow.
105;1;@VirginAmerica - amazing customer  service, again! 💕💕 RaeAnn in SF - she's the best! #customerservice #virginamerica #flying
3041;-1;@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.

917;-1;@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
7833;0;@JetBlue  What are your rules on checked baggage and carry ons from SLC to SJO?
6732;-1;@SouthwestAir husband on hold 2.5 hrs, got disconnected!New wait 30 min. Can't confirm res due to the fact he booked on line! Nuts!
1949;1;Very quick! TY. @united: @auciello I am sorry to hear this. Can you please follow and DM me the details of what transpired? ^JH
12236;0;@AmericanAir if I've booked an AA award on USAir metal, and space opens up on AA metal, can I change to the AA flight without fees?
11040;-1;@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
6368;0;@SouthwestAir What are your services? What promotion you have at the moment? #ModeloDeNegocio #innovation #innovacion #BusinessModel
1;1;@VirginAmerica plus you've added commercials to the experience... tacky.
8032;0;@JetBlue where do I add my AA loyalty number to my Jetblue reservation?
6047;-1;@SouthwestAir Learn how to give folks on multiple flights the same day boarding position at least if you can't give them  boarding passes.
9127;-1;"@USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, ""because I told you to!"" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!"
13496;-1;@AmericanAir wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass
2720;-1;"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL"

14362;-1;@AmericanAir Reservation Line won't let me speak to a representative because they are too busy. They literally disconnect you. Why bother?
3117;1;@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice

9768;0;@USAirways any idea when flight 703 to Miami will leave for a second time?
3762;-1;@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight.
213;-1;@VirginAmerica You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What's the deal?

14500;-1;@AmericanAir @cheerUPDATES So you're saying the call center is understaffed?
1466;-1;@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
4497;-1;@SouthwestAir customer service you shouldn't use those words wasted my time and took my money #BadBussiness #Theft http://t.co/63zaQ2lt8f
3042;-1;@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
9126;-1;@USAirways Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head
2419;0;@united flights taking off from IAD this afternoon?
5085;-1;@SouthwestAir been holding for 1 hour and 10 minutes. To rebook Cancelled Flightlation.You guys need more help!
3294;1;@united thanks! Everything a-ok now.
6737;-1;"@SouthwestAir allows other passengers 2 harass u after their gate agents mistakeFURIOUS they are doing NOTHING about it &amp; my 6yo was scared"
1500;-1;@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
9018;-1;@USAirways 59 minutes now. Nice customer service you got going on.
1521;-1;@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent
13354;-1;@AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N
11122;-1;@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice
4232;-1;@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
7686;-1;@JetBlue You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter's friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting.
8820;-1;@JetBlue @EllaHenderson the highlight of being delayed #freeconcert
4430;-1;@SouthwestAir Supposed to take off almost 2 hours ago....#vacationfail #frozenwater? #gettingimpatient #theycouldatleastofferfreebooze
12045;-1;"@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible."
390;0;@VirginAmerica Atlantic ploughs a lone furrow in the #MiddleEast http://t.co/vw4P4T4tLh @TheNationalUAE
12537;-1;@AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!
14440;-1;@AmericanAir not only did you rebook me on the wrong day, your phone system says it can't handle the volume and hangs up on me!!!
7124;1;@JetBlue I love flying with u, but I have a question, why is one of ur planes called ny jets
5913;-1;@SouthwestAir no one has answers...no one can help. There is always a different story to why my and my fiancee' can't be helped.
12182;-1;@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
8592;0;@JetBlue plans to offer direct flights from #JFK to #DaytonaBeach, #Florida starting next #February.… http://t.co/oYLlRZQU5m
4806;1;@SouthwestAir TY for your consideration!
13113;-1;@AmericanAir When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr..
11551;1;@USAirways Thx to gate agt John Pascucci for finding us a flight from CLT to PVD after our original one was Cancelled Flightled http://t.co/YiwLhQhZgp
8238;0;@JetBlue alright.
8044;1;"@JetBlue i love this song &lt;3 thanks @JetBlue"
14322;1;@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ✈ :-)
3993;-1;@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude.
11834;-1;"@USAirways 
That is not an excuse to have such a poor website Flight Booking Problems options! My yearly vacation is about to fall through, ubetter do smth!"
11918;-1;@AmericanAir if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah.
14504;-1;@AmericanAir  many have missed connections already b/c of delayed flight which will finally board soon
6609;-1;@SouthwestAir Buying Early Bird was pointless. You moved me to a diff flight b/c first one was delayed, so I lost my boarding position.
5319;-1;@SouthwestAir is really gonna hear my mouth about this bag situation.
14409;-1;@AmericanAir - gold elite loyalty customer..can't count on my hometown preferred airline to do right. #bummed..
7119;-1;delete your account @JetBlue
2421;-1;@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
5604;1;@SouthwestAir thank you so so much for sending me to LA for #DestinationDragons! Tonight is gonna rock😎
1750;-1;@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
14379;0;@AmericanAir Next Friday, I'll take AA3074 to LGA.Sat morning, US1951+US874.Do I have to take my bags at LGA or I get them to my final dest?
13203;0;@AmericanAir Will my us air points now be combined with yours?
12254;0;@AmericanAir have your experts seen this? this is right at RDU airport. http://t.co/mPliO6DYgn
14226;-1;@AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it's winter! staff better
338;-1;@VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly 😥
8407;-1;@JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY??
11855;-1;@USAirways I got up at 2 am for a 5 am flight from bos to Charlotte which I found was Cancelled Flightled once I got to the gate (1)
1341;-1;"@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket"
13977;1;@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
7982;0;@JetBlue Thank you.
12086;-1;@AmericanAir that's 16+ extra hours of travel time. Missed vacation time and now you guys are messing with my professional life.
3640;0;@united yes, you can. I will DM.
329;-1;@VirginAmerica my luggage is gone. I've filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage.
14406;-1;@AmericanAir Rebooked for tomorrow morning. Never been here - not sure what I can see before tomorrow morning!
3004;-1;@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
6960;0;@JetBlue lmfao.
4090;0;"@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare &amp; seats?"
11307;0;@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
9828;-1;@USAirways @AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to computers being down. What backup plan is in place for this??
2322;-1;@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
6667;-1;@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
7009;-1;@JetBlue we haven't even gotten off the plane yet! I can't afford to miss my flight back to Boston! Ugh.
4197;-1;@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)
3549;-1;@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround
9650;-1;@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
8363;-1;talked to a @JetBlue manager and she offered we pay 3X's in cash what we originally paid #nothanks #jetblue #ripoff #flyunited
4203;1;Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
13642;-1;@AmericanAir I certainly hope my LA /PBI on 25 th has a NEW plane . The seats on Feb 11 th flight ( in reverse) God awful
11761;-1;@USAirways we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate?
12418;0;@AmericanAir Amazing to watch @chasefoster (who travels with celebs all over the world) show the youth of America who *not* to fly with.
13088;-1;@AmericanAir get me outta here
13176;-1;@AmericanAir now the second flight I was put on was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation!! Missed my first meeting!!#outraged😡😡

1524;-1;@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
7617;-1;@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
153;0;@VirginAmerica is your website ever coming back online?

7479;1;@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
6212;0;@SouthwestAir is there anything I can do to get tickets for @Imaginedragons at @VinylVegas? It would mean so much to me #DestinationDragons
12693;-1;"@AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids."

3028;-1;.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
2969;-1;@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.

2573;-1;@united I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed?
11472;-1;@USAirways you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance!
3186;-1;@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.
12145;-1;@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
2768;1;@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
4831;-1;@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
4223;-1;@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
14135;-1;@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
2106;-1;@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
2679;-1;@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.

1387;1;@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
14169;-1;@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
13904;-1;@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.
13080;-1;@AmericanAir Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM.
14150;-1;@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles

14163;-1;@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
4841;0;@SouthwestAir I'm flying out of CUN tomorrow To DEN - can I change my flight due to the travel advisory??
3594;-1;@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!
6035;0;@SouthwestAir Hi do you know why WN4287 is already delayed until 9:35pm tonight? Thanks !
6852;-1;@JetBlue service getting worse and worse. Plane can't fly waiting on a 2nd aircraft. So much for planning.
10112;-1;@USAirways a member of your staff at PHL just gave us excellent customer care. Shame the same couldn't be said for the past 24 hours.
8705;0;@JetBlue, flights 1970, 1366, and 1552 will fly over after 1 am on your way into @BostonLogan - mind taking ocean approach so we can sleep?
4177;0;@united can you send me another confirmation email?
1308;-1;@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
9106;0;@USAirways How do I add my TSA Pre number to an existing reservation?
3452;-1;@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?
3695;-1;@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
4242;-1;@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
11348;-1;@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
2198;1;@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
8966;-1;@USAirways  is there a better time to call? My flight is on Friday and I need to change it. Worried I may be on hold until then.
4425;-1;@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
6150;0;@SouthwestAir k but who won destination dragons
943;-1;@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
822;0;@united where is my flight voucher?
5005;-1;@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
6612;0;@SouthwestAir RDU flights expected to be ok this afternoon and tonight?
12469;-1;@AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues

12175;-1;@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
2538;-1;@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM
14281;1;@AmericanAir Hmm. Looks like you looked at my tweet from last month, not this one. Was able to get U.K. agent to help me, thanks.
9503;1;@USAirways 1899. Thanks
5207;-1;@SouthwestAir did anyone come into work today? u should have all the pilots and flight attendants answer phones if no one is flying
13935;1;@AmericanAir #americanview New paint scheme looks great! #usairways http://t.co/Gt6umHbh43
13195;-1;@AmericanAir I need to rebook and I cannot get an agent. Can you help?

10682;-1;@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
5954;0;@SouthwestAir yes can do
10998;-1;"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
12600;-1;@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario

10789;0;@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
2204;-1;@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it

13528;-1;@AmericanAir this merger with @USAirways @usairwis a cluster of inefficiency and misinformation.  When is it going to be done?
4158;0;@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
7449;-1;@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??
13140;-1;@AmericanAir am on hold for the 2nd time today. Need help with confirming the new flights you arranged for me. Can you expedite this?
13550;-1;@AmericanAir trying to change my flight and you just hang up on ppl bc call volume is high. That's a joke, right?
8415;-1;@JetBlue False - agent let us do an extra leg room upgrade for $ but not upgrade to mint. Poor business practices. #badcustomerservice
2193;-1;@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
11328;-1;@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
12661;-1;@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed.
10016;-1;@USAirways in 140 characters? Yea right.   Thanks for patronizing.
1015;-1;"@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb"
5124;-1;@SouthwestAir why was flight 4199 out of Boston tmrw @ 1230 Cancelled Flightled?
13164;-1;"@AmericanAir I'm trying to make a reservation with a &lt; 2 year old lap child. Don't see any option online. How do I proceed with reservation?"
7418;-1;@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
7409;-1;@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now.
8989;-1;"@USAirways DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason."
2871;-1;@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
9;1;@VirginAmerica it was amazing, and arrived an hour early. You're too good to me.
10136;-1;@USAirways @Sb5551 Um, WE knew this storm was coming, ? Is why didn't USeless Air?  Staff accordingly u idiots!
1838;-1;@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
4804;1;.@SouthwestAir Thx for the follow up. Just sent DM
255;0;@VirginAmerica beats expectations, shares take off - Santa Cruz Sentinel http://t.co/qm9dQbai6G
7026;1;@JetBlue shows us their sense of humor with these tongue-in-cheek flight etiquette videos: http://t.co/GGuAA1JvDF
5713;-1;@SouthwestAir you were my go to airline now not so much!! You say you care but I now see not so much! Right now, you suck!!
12677;-1;@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
3324;-1;@united I have and been denied! I called and got hung up on. Did speaks with manager on second call
7714;1;@JetBlue OK, thank you.
1581;0;@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin
11148;-1;@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative
924;-1;@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
2779;0;@united OK, thanks for the clarification.
10700;1;@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
7891;0;@JetBlue by any chance do u offer fresh guacamole on your flights
6132;-1;@SouthwestAir doesn't even have gluten free peanuts. whyyy me??
13216;-1;@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!
5320;-1;@SouthwestAir you guys need better communication to your customers. This is rude and unprofessional.
7312;-1;@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
7102;0;"@JetBlue Tell me more 😳...

Because I need a 1 way to NYC, and I might choose you"
6042;0;@SouthwestAir If you read my tweet it is a gap in process for folks that take multiple flights in one day.
3775;-1;@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
4835;-1;@SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
12328;-1;@AmericanAir I'll be sticking with @southwest in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service.
4964;1;@SouthwestAir My Fav!!!!
10971;-1;@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
539;-1;@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue.
7483;1;@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
2745;1;@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
3719;-1;@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
13968;0;@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags
6819;0;@JetBlue I was returning from @FoodNetwork #SOBEWFF so I had limited carry on space in my tummy. Next flight I'll try that snack!
13659;0;@AmericanAir please rebook me from Seattle to Columbus Tue 2/24, locator: KARAAX, name: Mitchell M Neuer
9337;-1;@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
13319;-1;@AmericanAir Are there any travel advisories for Toronto, ON today? I can't access anything regarding international travel on your website--
4468;-1;@SouthwestAir Thanks for the text, but not exactly timely 8). Data throughout issues today maybe? http://t.co/aaU9MKA6Zy
667;-1;@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx
7575;-1;@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
11211;1;@USAirways thanks for slowing the inbound plane down so that we didn't need to worry about 4438 EYW being Late Flight. Great holz ahead. Cheers! 😀
8549;1;@JetBlue What a great idea! #cometoAustin
5063;-1;@SouthwestAir want to pick up a customer from @SpiritAirlines sign me up 🙌😏
11023;0;@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?
10975;0;@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.
1353;-1;@united you are terrible.
13323;1;@AmericanAir finally called! Can't get met Seattle so refund will be processed. Thanks

8662;-1;@JetBlue I was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that I was running 10min Late Flight for. Turns out it left over an hour Late Flight.
2703;-1;@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
3330;0;@united What delivery service do you use? I'd like to call them myself.
8053;1;@JetBlue @WSJ #JETBLUE treated me right as a #disabledtraveler thanks for a no hassle flight to @jamaica
11829;-1;@USAirways Why is there no contact email for customer complaints?
9588;1;@USAirways Thanks!
3584;-1;@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
13836;-1;"@AmericanAir found out my flight tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled &amp; got in the queue for a callback 3.5 hours ago…still nothing. Can I get rebooked??"
13454;-1;@AmericanAir @MallowFairy And how many times, exactly, should we call and leave our number for a call back? Because that hasn't worked.
5645;1;@SouthwestAir SEA to DEN. South Sound Volleyball team on its way! http://t.co/tN5cXCld6M
3376;-1;@united I sent you a dm hours ago
1256;0;@united I already did.
6190;-1;@SouthwestAir I'm miserable on your Orlando to Vegas nonstop right now. How big must a guest be for u to require 2 seats?  I'm in 1A btw.
11704;-1;@USAirways wont waive fees for flight Cancelled Flightlation due to #neptune To use credit, $200 fee. Couldnt reach destination @BostonBBB #notmyfault
9442;-1;@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
5348;-1;@SouthwestAir- I called @united and they solved the flight Cancelled Flightlation issue in 15minutes. May be ask them how to do it? #getmorehands
11003;-1;@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?
12490;-1;@AmericanAir We all did! Skipper's walk-around too :(
11476;-1;@USAirways I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help!
11125;0;@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
4175;-1;@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.
13460;-1;@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
4910;0;@SouthwestAir I have followed you. Awaiting your DM.
1852;-1;@united severely under staffed at Iah.
6316;-1;@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero.
12972;-1;@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!
14430;1;@AmericanAir - yep , they've been good.  Now can you make that 1535 flight to mci wait just a tick....😃
2105;0;@united 24 seats available on the 2:15 pm from ORD to RDU...I need 2 seats please
133;-1;@VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
13428;-1;@AmericanAir @Eleonora7 good luck I've been waiting a week
5029;-1;@SouthwestAir I was never able to talk so someone so had to buy another new ticket. Will be calling shortly for refund.
928;0;@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
823;-1;@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
7576;-1;@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
11632;-1;@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less
1531;-1;@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
1214;-1;@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!
504;1;@united thanks
12477;-1;"@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead."
10188;-1;"@USAirways Our flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; chaos abounds. I am in good humour. Please give me free everything to appease me."
6530;-1;@SouthwestAir I never got a Cancelled Flightlation text from this morning either #bushleague or a number to call #weakservice

9086;-1;"@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50."
13116;-1;@AmericanAir is there something wrong with the website? no matter what flight I select, it says it's no longer available.
8647;1;@JetBlue loving the free #wifi and #legroom ✈️ #SeattleBound

6588;1;@SouthwestAir got it squared away. Thank you. I had a man on the inside help me out!
1810;-1;@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!

5986;1;@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Congrats!
537;-1;@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.

13696;-1;@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers

7574;-1;@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it
1757;-1;@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
6019;1;@SouthwestAir Southwest is definitely my favorite airline to fly! :D
12383;-1;"@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts ""why this person was talking to her""."

9062;-1;@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate.
12685;-1;@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...

3556;-1;@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
11394;-1;@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease

1899;0;@united can you put Russell Daiber (on same ticket) as well into premium Eco? Appreciated!
4658;-1;@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
3005;-1;@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
